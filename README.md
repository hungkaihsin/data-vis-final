### Workflow
**Strongly suggest to create a new brach to start to work**

To clone the repo to the local environment, run:

To create different branch to start to work on
```
git checkout -b <your branch name>
```
Use checkout to switch to difference branches
```
git checkout <branch name>
```
To stage your code
```
git add .
```
To commit your change
```
git commit -m '<your commit text inside the quote>'
```
